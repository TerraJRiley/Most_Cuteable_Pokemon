Congrats, if you're reading this then you've found my repository for obtaining shiny pokemon via RNG manipulation within the 4th Gen games that I have access to.  There wasn't any good resource for narrowing down which pokemon I could and couldn't get at the time since I primarily accomplished this via the [Cute Charm Glitch]("https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cute_Charm_(Ability)#Effects_on_personality_value").  I have since improved my skills with RNG manipulation and learned how to manipulate shiny rng for pokemon that would otherwise be unable to be obtained via the cute charm glitch.  My code is a mess because I don't actually expect anybody to come across and read this.  But incase anybody does:

The primary Jupyter Notebook used [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to gather the data.  It's pretty cool that they set up a whole Pokemon API for a bunch of different kinds of data. :)

SO VERY MUCH CREDIT goes to [im a blisy ._.](https://www.youtube.com/@imablisy/featured) for making a bunch of videos going into detail on how to perform these rng manipulations.  Originally with the [set up of the cute charm glitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icFud3PS0v0) and then [everything else](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4o9bTT3px_idofrSWZ3jWN3pJqWglvW2).

Furthermore, huge shout out to [Riyaly](https://www.youtube.com/@Riyaly) for posting an actual way to skip forward days and thus level up the [HG/SS safari zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5kMxHMMB_8).  

I also used [this calculator](http://thepikaclub.co.uk/tools/Munchlax/munchlax.php) for finding my munchlax trees and just generally use [mrtenda](https://github.com/mrtenda/voltorbflipdotcom)'s [Voltorb Flip calculator](http://voltorbflip.com/).

Honestly, a lot of pokemon nerds make a lot of cool tools for the games. :)
